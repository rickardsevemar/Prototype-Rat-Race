#Prototype Theme 2 - Rat Race

The second prototype theme was set to be built on trust.

The game idea is to play with conventional symbols and their opposites. The integral core mechanic will be time, 
and the player will be guided to collect money in order to gain more time in order to solve the puzzles inside a maze. 
The maze itself is a lie. Once the player has found their way through the level and exits through the last door, 
they will find themselves walking into the same room they started in, in a desperate pursuit of more money in order to have more time. 
In other words, the game could be interpreted as an existential game showcasing the trust people put in the “rat race” that never really ends, 
it only starts over. As soon as time runs out, the game will end and the player will be asked to try again, 
or to quit and do something useful with their life. In essence the point is that the player trusts the system, of having to gain more time, 
to provide them with an appropriate ending with a tangible goal.
